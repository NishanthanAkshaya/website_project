		<h2> Exposure Triangle </h2>
		<p> One of the most important part of photogrphy to is exposure, as teh whole concept of phootgrpahy is built around the amount of light. You'll see just how important light is if you look at the history of photography  <p>
		<p> Exposure is the control of brightness or darkness. Many photogrpahers feel a lack of consistency with exposure when taking pictures, but through undertsanding th 3 factors that affect exposure, this can be reduced </p>
		<h3>ISO(Used to be called ASA)</h3>
		<p> ISO is how sensitive the camera sesor is to light. The higher the ISO, the more light it picks up. However, too much ISO is noise and adds a sketchy feel and unnecessary extra light </p>
		<h3>Shutter Speed</h3>
		<p>
			Shutter speed is how long the shutter is open. Fast is 1/1000 of a second, and slow could be 20 minutes. If there is a lower shutter speed, more light is sensed. Blurring things can show movement in an image, and can be done with a slow shutter speed. It is better to do 1/250 to eliminate your own hand shaking or use a tripod device to keep it steady.
		</p>
		<h3>Aperture</h3>
		<p>
			Aperture is the amount of light a lens lets through to hit sensor. If the lense is wide, there is more light. However, the number will be lower. It also controls depth of field or sharpness. A Large number means that not a lot of light comes through, but everything in frame(background and foreground) is clear, while small numbers mean that a lot of light comes in, but onle a specific focus point. Around F16-32 is used by landscape photogrpoahers because a lot in the fram is clear, even if there may not be alot of light. Aperture is also called F-stop.
		</p>
		<p> The light meter helps automatically changes one, two, or all of the exposure setting to get a properly exposed photo in automatic mode. In manual mode, it will simply guide the photogeppher </p>
		<h3>Composition </h3>
		<p> There are many different types of composition grids and styles, like the rule of thirds, where the subject is in one axis/intersection of the grid, not in the center. However, composition is more than just grids. </p>
		<p> Here are some tips for composition: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Try same shot from differnrt angles</li>
			<li>Look at all elemtns in the frame </li>
			<li>Choose between landcape and portrait</li>
			<li>Learn to translate our 3d vision into what the 2d picture will look like</li>
			<li>Colour, contrast and balance are also of equal importance to grids for composition </li>
			<li>Think of abstract colours and forms</li>
			<li>Think of negative space</li>
			<li> Angles are important, as a higher angle can make someone feel detachesd or as if they were ruling over the subject, while eyelevel makes the viewer more involved with the picture, and lowshot gives the subject of photo more power </li>
