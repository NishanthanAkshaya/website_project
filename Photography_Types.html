		<p> A quick google search will give you tens, maybe hundreds of types of photography, but here, we will only be going through a few major types of photography and some of their attributes. <p>
		<p> There are two main ways you can do photography: Using film and using digital photography </p>

		<h2 class = "film"> Film Pros</h2>	
		<ul class = "film">
			<li>Greater difference between light and darkness that is more pronounced in black-and-white photography </li>
			<li>Some may prefer the warm grainy look of film, similar to a preference of a vinyl record to an MP3 player</li>
			<li>Lower upfront cost</li>
		</ul>
				<h2 class = "film1"> Film Cons</h2>	
		<ul class = "film1">
			<li>Limited exposures (arrow) The number of exposures correlates to the number of pictures you can take</li>
			<li>Develoing images can be difficult to and time-consuming</li>
			<li>Accumulation of film roll cost can be more more expensive than simply buying a digital camera</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class = "digital"> Digital Pros </h2>
		<ul class = "digital1">
			<li>Instantly see the pictures you’re taking and review as you’re taking them</li>
			<li>Easily transferable photos, as they are digitized</li>
			<li>Extremely easy editing, as there is an abundance of softwares</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class = "digital"> Digital Cons </h2>
		<ul class = "digital1">
			<li>Not all cameras, especcila basic ones, are good quality</li>
			<li>Higher start-up cost, but the usage of the memory card as opposed to film roll can balance it out</li>
			<li>Doesn’t have the grainy warmth of film, but it can be somewhat replicated digitally  </li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Differnt Fields of Photography </h2> <!--Pictures for the section below are larger than normal so the viewer sees detail-->
			<p> Here we will be going to explore some of the various different types of photography and a few of their characteristics. A quick google search of photography types will give you a lot of different types, but right now, this site talk about Portrait Photography, Landscape Photogrpahy, Astronomy Photogrpahy, Photojournalism, and Architectural Photogrpahy <p>
			<h3>Portrait Photography </h3>
			<h4> This type of photography captures the personality and emotions of the subject </h4>
			<ul class = "centerList"> 
				<li> Can be candid or posed, full body or close-ups </li>
				<li> Backgrounds are usually blurred to keep focus on subject, using a wide aperture</li>
				<li>Most portrait photographers don’t get too close with their cameras, to avoid distrortion of their features ore creating an unflattering image </li>
				<li>They move back and use telephoto lenses or other close-up lenses and zoom in</li>
				<li>Usually don’t use flash or light in the front to add shadows to the facial features of the person</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Landscape Photography </h3>
			<h4> Captures the diversity and natural beauty of a landscape in an interetsing way</h4>
			<ul class = "centerList"> 
				<li>Uusally most of the elements are in focus, meaning tha the aperture level is lower </li>
				<li>Wide-angle leses are used </li>
				<li>Movement is often included to add interest, so the shutter speeds may be lower for some pictures</li>
				<li>They move back and use telephoto lenses or other close-up lenses and zoom in</li>
				<li>Usually tripods are used to reduce shaking, especially when the shutter speed is slow </li>
				<li>Water is used as a mirror in many cases, and people may also be incorporated for avriety</li>
			</ul>
			<img class = "imgType" src = "Landscape photos.jpg" alt = "Examples of landscape photography" width = 90%/>
			<h3>Astronomy photography</h3>
			<h4>This type of photography captures the  night sky</h4>
			<ul class = "centerList">
				<li>Astrophotogtrpahy camera is used for the best results, but a DSLR camera and wide-angle lenses work just as well</li>
				<li>Tripod is essential due to the longer shutter speed commonly used</li>
				<li>Finding the right place is essential</li>
				<li>Uses manual setting to get  maximum shutter speed, widest aperture, and high ISO to get details in the night sky(very high ISO can make the image grainy)</li>
				<li>Usually the white-balnce is adjusted to maek up for light pollution</li>
				<li>USes RAW file format mostly</li>
				<li>Has a timer so that the force of pressing the shutter button doesn’t shake the camera and cause unwanted blur</li>
				<li>Many ayronomy photgrahers layer images together for interesting compositions and use dark frames(no light enters the lens) layered to reduce unwanted noise from the high ISO</li>
				<li>Editing softwares and telescopes are commonyl used</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Photojournalism</h3>
			<h4>This type of photogrpahy tells a story through images</h4>
			<ul class = "centerList">
				<li>Isn't time to make the perfect shot, as they are not planned and are candid moments </li>
				<li>The photographer evaluates the compositojn of the image, like balance and background, as well as the use of light and colour and how it affects the message of the photo</li>
				<li>Distance form the subject to photographer is important</li>
			</ul class = "centerList">
			<img class = "imgType" src = "Photojournalism.png" alt = "Examples of phototjournalism" width = 90%/>
			<h3> Architechtural Photogrpahy </h3>
			<h4> This type of photogrpahy captures architecture in an interesting way to highlight its elegance and display the building almost like as a timeless creation</h4>
			<ul class = "centerList">
				<li>This type of photogrpahy values different angles/perspectives and the use of light to show depth and add emotion</li>
				<li>Mpstly use wide-angle lenses to get larger structure of building</li>
				<li>As wekll as tikt-shift lenses that move independently of the camera that can avoid perspective distortion</li>
				<li>However, some people states that the images don;t show the labour and hardwork put into building it or the future of the building, therefore ommiting a vital aspect of the building being photogroahed</li>
			</ul>
